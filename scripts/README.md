# Scripts

This folder contains the scripts required for automating this process of generating a map.
To generate a fast map showing only the latest estimates for each country, use:

```shell
scripts/make-latest.sh
```

To generate a map with all available data, use `make-full.sh` instead.

**Run all scripts from the root directory of this repository**
